# Set-up
```{r Import and clean data}
# Read in the data
pokemon_data <- clean_names(read.csv("pokemon.csv")) 

# Create a data frame without missing values that contains the type1 labels
pokemon_data <- pokemon_data %>% 
    select(-percentage_male, -type2) %>%  
    filter(type1 %in% c("ghost", "fairy", "dragon")) %>%  # Let's limit this to a few pokemon
    mutate(type1 = droplevels(type1)) %>% # Few poke have data for these
    drop_na() 

#Part of the project requirement is to use at least : 
#1. one {purrr} function outside the basic map family such as walk_*
#2. purrr::nest %>% mutate()
#3. parallel iteration 

#I tried to look at the data and see how I can help meet these requirements. The app that you areated look great :) So I tried to manipulate a data in a way that does not change the purpose of the app but still meet the requirements of the project.  For this I created a function that will basically pull the first row of any dataframe. Then, I used that function in the pokemon_data grouped by type1 in order to use the "purrr::nest %>% mutate()". I used walk instead of map so it will iterate over and over until it pulls the full dataframe.This way you meet the requirements without changing the dataset of your project. I know this is can be tricky but maybe it will inspire to acutally use purrr::nest %>% mutate() in a more useful way that I did not think of since you know the data better that I do.

#I made this same change in the app.R too. 

#I could not figure out a way to use parallel mapping. Make sure you add it to your project as it is part of the requirements. 

#Overall, I really like your shiny dashboard and the clustering function you created :)

first_row <- function(.x) {
  first <- .x[1, ]  #pull the firt row of the data
  tibble::as_tibble(first)
}

  group_by(type1) %>%

    mutate(., data = walk(data, first_row)) %>%
